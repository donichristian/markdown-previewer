  ## 🔍 Overview

 This project is a Markdown Previewer, designed to provide users with a real-time preview of Markdown syntax-rendered content as they type. It offers a convenient way to visualize how Markdown text will appear when rendered, facilitating the creation and editing of Markdown documents.

The Markdown Previewer is built using JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, ESLint, and PostCSS. JavaScript is employed to handle the logic behind parsing Markdown syntax and updating the preview in real-time. React is utilized for building the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. Tailwind CSS is leveraged for styling the components, enabling rapid prototyping and easy customization. Vite serves as the build tool, optimizing the development workflow with fast bundling and hot module replacement. ESLint is used for code linting to maintain code quality and consistency. PostCSS is employed for processing CSS, enabling the use of modern CSS features and enhancing compatibility across different browsers.

With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration of modern web technologies, this Markdown Previewer offers users a streamlined way to create and preview Markdown content, making the writing and editing process more efficient and enjoyable.

## 🚀 Getting Started

 To get started with this project, follow these steps:<br>
1. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install` or `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Start the development server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. This will start a development server at <http://localhost:3000/>.
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor and start exploring the codebase.
4. To build the project for production, run `yarn build` or `npm run build`. This will create a production-ready build of the project in the `dist` directory.
5. To preview the production build, run `yarn preview` or `npm run preview`. This will open the production build in your default web browser.
6. To lint the code using ESLint, run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`. This will check the code for any errors or warnings according to the rules defined in `.eslintrc.cjs`.
7. To generate a production-ready build of the project with Tailwind CSS, run `yarn build:tailwind` or `npm run build:tailwind`. This will create a new build of the project with Tailwind CSS applied.

That's it! You should now have a basic understanding of how to work with this project.
